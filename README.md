# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a submission repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo is based on [this](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) provided snake game example.

In this project, I extended the Snake game, to create a pet simulation similarly to the tamagochi. The Game is a turtle simulation with the goal of feeding the turtle to keep it in a good mood. Food can be placed by clicking into the game area, but watch out! clicking the turtle will reduce the remaining mood. Longest time alive will be added to a list and saved.
